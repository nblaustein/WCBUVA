        UVA Women's Club Basketball brings together 12 talented players from all over the country, ranging from first-years to grad students studying a wide range of majors. We're a diverse bunch, but we share a love for the game. Our team's recent successes, like winning Regionals in 2022 and 2024, and grabbing third place at Nationals in Wichita, Kansas, in 2022, show our dedication and teamwork. Now, we're getting ready to compete at Nationals in Madison, Wisconsin. If you'd like to support us, you can contribute through our Treasurer's Venmo. Every little bit helps us travel and compete against stronger competition!!  </p>
